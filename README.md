# PopEngine

PopEngine is a SPA made to organize daily delivery tasks and manage dispatchers’ shift assignments.
You can add new users which can have assigned tasks. The tasks are displayed as a schedule.

First you create tasks that have name, due time, location.
Then you assign those tasks to users.

## Why this exists

I was expierencing logistical problems in one of my past workplaces and since I was learnig to code I decided to create this project and solve at least one of these problems.
